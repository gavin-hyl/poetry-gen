accursed hire:\\n        That with false-forged lies, which thou didst tell,\\n        In my true love did stir up coals of ire,\\n    The sparks whereof let kindle thine own fire,\\n        And catching hold on thine own wicked head\\n        Consume thee quite, that didst with guile conspire\\n        In my sweet peace such breaches to have bred.\\n    Shame be thy meed, and mischief thy reward,\\n        Due to thyself that it for me prepared.\", 'Since I did leave the presence of my love,\\n        Many long weary days have I outworn:\\n        And many nights, that slowly seemed to move\\n        Their sad protract from evening until morn.\\n    For when as day the heaven doth adorn,\\n        I wish that night the noyous day would end:\\n        And when as night hath us of light forlorn,\\n        I wish that day would shortly reascend.\\n    Thus I the time with expectation spend,\\n        And fain my grief with changes to beguile,\\n        That further seems his term still to extend,\\n        And maketh every minute seem a mile.\\n    So sorrow still doth seem too long to last,\\n        But joyous hours do fly away too fast.', \"Since I have lacked the comfort of that light,\\n        The which was wont to lead my thoughts astray:\\n        I wander as in darkness of the night,\\n        Afraid of every danger's least dismay.\\n    Ne ought I see, though in the clearest day,\\n        When others gaze upon their shadows vain:\\n        But th'only image of that heavenly ray,\\n        Whereof some glance doth in mine eye remain.\\n    Of which beholding the idea plain,\\n        Through contemplation of my purest part:\\n        With light thereof I do myself sustain,\\n        And thereon feed my love-afamished heart.\\n    But with such brightness whilst I fill my mind,\\n        I starve my body and mine eyes do blind.\"]\n",
